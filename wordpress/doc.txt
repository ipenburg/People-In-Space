v plugin_dir_path suddenly doesn't exist when used in a class. That's because
  when the class is compiled the function isn't yet available.
v Read in the HTML snippet from a seperate file
v Make DOMDocument uitput just the div we need
- How much of the original widget can we keep? Or should we create a much
  simpler derivate? We now load all our assets, but that borks the whole of
  WordPress because it assumes we can modify the body.
v Put a wrapper around the widget with a unique classname,
  PeopleInSpaceWidget
v Use that to detect WordPress from the script.
v Use that classname in the body of the widget as well to sync it
v get the PROPS URL from assets/scripts/controller.js
v Get the value from upstream
v Hook in the CSS and JS
- Cache the value in WordPress
- Add override value as widget parameter (also for testing)
v Bypass cross-domain XHR by putting the result with PHP in the HTML already.
  The model just fills the pipe.
